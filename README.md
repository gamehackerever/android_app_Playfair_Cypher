PlayFair Cipher Implementation

This app provides an implementation of Playfair cipher, a cryptographic technique used for encryption and decryption of messages written in Kotlin.


Key Features:
It generates a 5x5 matrix based on the provided key for encryption.
Encrypts plain text using playfair cipher or any other keyword provided.
Decrypts ciphered text using playfair cipher.
Handles repeated characters by inserting ‘X’ between repeated adjacent characters.
Utilizes Matrix operations to perform encryption and decryption based on the generated key matrix.


Usage:
To Use the PlayFair Cipher 
1. Set the ‘Key’ variable with your chosen keyword for encryption and decryption.
2. Set the ‘plaintext’ variable with the message you want to encrypt.
3. Run the program to obtain the encrypted ciphertext.
4. To decrypt the ciphered text, use the same ‘key’ and the obtained ciphered text.
