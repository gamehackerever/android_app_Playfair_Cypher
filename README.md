# Playfair Cipher Learning App

Welcome to the Playfair Cipher Learning App! This app aims to educate users about the Playfair Cipher, a classical encryption technique used in cryptography. The app provides step-by-step guidance for both encoding and decoding messages using the Playfair Cipher.

## Features

- *Interactive Learning:* The app guides users through each step of the Playfair Cipher process, making it easy to understand and apply.
- *Encoding:* Users can input plaintext messages and the app will generate the corresponding ciphertext using the Playfair Cipher algorithm.
- *Decoding:* Users can input ciphertext messages and the app will decrypt them to reveal the original plaintext message.
- *Error Handling:* The app includes error handling mechanisms to ensure accurate encryption and decryption results.

## How to Use

1. *Clone the Repository:* Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/gamehackerever/android_app_Playfair_Cypher.git

2. *Open the App:* Open the app on your preferred development environment or platform.

3. *Follow Instructions:* Follow the on-screen instructions to learn and practice encoding and decoding messages using the Playfair Cipher.

4. *Explore Code:* Feel free to explore the codebase to understand how the Playfair Cipher algorithm is implemented in the app.

## Technologies Used

- *Programming Language:* The app is built using Kotlin.
- *Version Control:* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are used for version control and repository hosting.
